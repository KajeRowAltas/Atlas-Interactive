# Gaming

Workspace for video game design and experimentation from the MongoDB project list.

## Structure
- `design/` — Game concepts, storyboards, and mechanics docs.
- `prototypes/` — Early playable builds or engine experiments.
- `art/` — Assets, mockups, and shader references.

## Setup
1. Pick your engine or framework (e.g., Unity, Godot, web) and track setup steps in this README.
2. Keep environment-specific configuration in `.env.example` or engine-specific config templates.
3. Reference shared schemas in `../../Shared_Resources/Mongodb/` when aligning narrative or player data across projects.

## Next steps
Document new feature folders as they appear to keep the repository scalable and easy to navigate.
