# Nutrition

Workspace for nutrition tracking, meal planning, and health-focused workflows.

## Structure
- `data/` — Intake logs, macros, and nutrition data exports.
- `analysis/` — Scripts or notebooks for dietary insights.
- `docs/` — Guidelines, playbooks, and operating notes.

## Setup
1. Add your preferred data format (CSV/JSON) into `data/`.
2. If scripting, create a virtual environment and record dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
3. Use schemas in `../../Shared_Resources/Mongodb/` when aligning nutrition data with other Atlas services.

## Next steps
Document new components (APIs, dashboards, automations) here as the workspace grows.
