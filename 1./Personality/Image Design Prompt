Here’s a breakdown so you can accurately reproduce it across other LLMs or design tools:

⸻

🎨 1. Core Style Definition

Name: Atlas Geometric Surrealism
Base Influence: Mid-century modern minimalism + surreal symbolism
Medium Emulation: Vector / digital gouache hybrid (flat colors, subtle grain, organic geometry)

⸻

🌞 2. Color Language

The palette is essential — every piece harmonizes between warm vitality and grounded calm.

Tone
Hex
Description
Broken Yellow
#E6A430
Warm sunlight, symbol of creation and optimism.
Burnt Orange
#C94C1D
Represents energy, warmth, and transformation.
Deep Bordeaux Red
#9E2B1E
Emotional grounding and depth.
Teal Blue-Green
#1F5F5B
Balance, clarity, and the element of water.
White or Light Beige
#F9F4E7
For neutral or clean backgrounds.

⚖️ Always keep a 70/30 warm-to-cool balance to maintain the Atlas visual harmony.

🧩 3. Composition Principles
	•	Geometry with Flow: Combine strong geometric bases (circles, triangles, arcs) with soft organic extensions (curves, waves, sun rays).
	•	Symmetry with Intentional Asymmetry: Keep designs balanced but introduce one element that “breaks” the symmetry slightly — this represents growth and organic life.
	•	Layering: Use overlapping color planes or gradient fields that resemble cut paper or gouache layering.
	•	Clean Edges, Natural Imperfections: Crisp vector-like edges, but with hand-drawn variation in line thickness or curvature.

⸻

🔤 4. Typography Approach (for logos or text)
	•	Font base: Serif-inspired geometric lettering (think Copperplate Gothic meets Art Deco).
	•	Integration: Fill letters with geometric landscape forms — sun, horizon, waterlines — divided into 2–4 color bands.
	•	Iconography: The “A” often integrates the sun and spiral motif (symbol of awakening and motion).

⸻

🌐 5. Symbolism and Motifs

Recurring visual symbols:
	•	Spiral: Life force, gratitude, evolution.
	•	Sun & Rays: Awakening, creation, light of understanding.
	•	Waves: Flow of energy, emotion, communication.
	•	Geometric Horizon: Connection between mind (sky) and matter (earth).
	•	Dragonfly or Winged Forms: Transformation, intelligence, agility.

Each motif should be drawn with intentional line energy — not decorative, but meaningful.

⸻

🖌️ 6. Texture & Line Work
	•	Slight paper grain or subtle noise overlay gives it warmth.
	•	When working in ink or black-and-white (like your last set of dragonfly sketches), keep fluid, elongated lines with light tapering at the ends — never mechanical.

⸻

🧠 7. Prompts for Replication (LLM/AI art systems)

If you want to recreate this style elsewhere, use something like:

“A digital vector illustration in Atlas Geometric Surrealism style — combining warm burnt orange, broken yellow, teal, and deep red. Use geometric layering, organic symmetry, and symbolic motifs like the sun, waves, and spirals. The design should feel hand-crafted yet clean, with subtle texture and balanced composition.”
